# odin-recipes

For this project, i will create a website with recipes using only HTML. 
I will use the skills I've learned so far in The Odin Project.

It's something simple, but's necessary for my learning process.

I will use links (a), an unordered list (ul), an ordered list (ol), and images (img).
