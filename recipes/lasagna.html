        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. <br>
                Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, <br>
                Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, <br>
                for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. <br>
                 Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
            </li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, tamaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. <br>
                 Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. <br>
                 Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. <br>
                 Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. <br>
                 Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. <br>
                 Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before cutting; this helps it set and firm up.</li>
        </ol>
